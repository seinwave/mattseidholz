summary: A little note on how to keep me reading
---

I'm a book quitter. And I think everyone should be.

Reading is

Good books have a magical effect on my schedule. There are lots of little opportunities to thumb through

But if a book is so-so, I'm not going to read it over my morning oatmeal, or stay up too late with it, or choose it over YouTube, or NYT, or hackernews on the train.

The aggregate effect of all this is, when a book kinda sucks, it takes me ~5x longer to finish it.

Which is doubly bad because it means I'm spending _more_ time to get _less_ value.

That's why I'm quick to quit books. I don't want to spend 5x the price for spoiled avocados, and I don't want to spend 14 weeks reading books that suck.

So, what makes me less likely to quit a book?

I respect the author's point of view / perspective / intelligence
--> usually a combination of stylistic choices in the prose, what they select to write about, the implied positions / politics of the text

- Ambition
  --> Not just the MOST ambition, but the optimal amount of ambition
- My time is respected
  --> No fluff / fat, no diversions to nowhere, etc

- Focus
  --> Related to the above, but a little different
- Surprise
  --> Need to not feel like I'm slogging toward an outcome I already know
- Challenge
  --> I like to work a litle bit — but not too much — for my insight / fictive pleasure
