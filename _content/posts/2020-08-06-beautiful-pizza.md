summary: For my reference, how to make the best pizza

Oh man. Not to fill this blog with baking brags. But look at this shit.

_I've never done anything better_

And these weren't just pretty, either.

If you believe the [experts](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Pizza-Unlocking-Secrets-World-Class/dp/160774838X), pizza-crust texture should both cruchy AND delicate.

I thought I knew what that meant. And I thought that I'd achieved it before.

Ho ho, oh no.

I'm not disavowing my earlier efforts, exactly. They weren't bad. But today's pie was just a whole 'nother level.

The crust broke with this beautiful lightness in the mouth. The cook was consistent across the entire pie, too, which is a rare achievement for me.

_Ooh baby_

What was the secret? Once again, high-gluten flour.

_Makes everything better_

That, plus the following steps, which are what I do for all of my pies:

- A prefermented dough with 63% hydration (including extra-virgin olive oil)
- Using a [pizza steel](https://www.amazon.com/Artisan-Steel-Performance-Pizza-14-25/dp/B0765P2477/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=pizza+steel&qid=1596716653&sr=8-7)
- Oven pre-heated for â‰¥ 90 minutes, on 500 convection
- For the actual baking, throw the broiler on high, and cook for 4 and a half minutes

Documented here for posterity. Best pizza I've ever made!
